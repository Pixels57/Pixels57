## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Moaz Hashem

Iâ€™m a Senior 1 Computer Engineering student at Cairo University with a strong passion for backend development.
Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring various areas within computer engineering to broaden my understanding and skill set. I spend most of my time problem-solving and building projects that help me apply and deepen my knowledge of the tools and technologies Iâ€™m learning.
